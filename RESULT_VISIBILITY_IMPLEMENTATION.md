# Phase 1 Feature 3: Result Visibility Controls - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented comprehensive result visibility controls for the ranked choice voting application, allowing ballot creators to control when and how results are displayed to voters.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Backend Schema Updates (`convex/schema.ts`)
Added new fields to the `ballots` table:
- `resultVisibility`: Controls when results are visible ("live", "after_voting", "manual", "never")
- `showPartialResults`: Boolean to show all elimination rounds vs just final result
- `hideResultsUntilClosed`: Override to hide results until ballot is manually closed
- `resultsVisibleToPublic`: Controls whether results are visible to public or creator only

### 2. Backend Function Updates (`convex/ballots.ts`)

#### Updated `createBallot` mutation:
- Added optional parameters for all visibility settings
- Set sensible defaults: live results, show partial results, visible to public

#### Enhanced `getBallotResults` query:
- Added creator detection logic
- Implemented visibility rules based on settings
- Returns appropriate hidden state with reasons when results should not be visible
- Filters results based on `showPartialResults` setting

#### New `updateResultVisibility` mutation:
- Allows ballot creators to update visibility settings after creation
- Includes proper authorization checks
- Supports partial updates of visibility settings

### 3. Frontend Component Updates

#### Updated `ResultsView` component (`src/components/ResultsView.tsx`):
- Added support for hidden results state with informative UI
- Added creator controls section for managing visibility settings
- Implemented real-time visibility setting updates
- Added visual indicators for different visibility states

#### Updated `BallotView` component (`src/components/BallotView.tsx`):
- Added user authentication detection
- Added creator status checking
- Integrated visibility update mutation
- Passed appropriate props to ResultsView component

#### Enhanced `CreateBallot` component (`src/components/CreateBallot.tsx`):
- Added comprehensive result visibility settings section
- Implemented radio buttons for visibility modes with descriptions
- Added checkboxes for additional visibility options
- Integrated settings into ballot creation flow

## Visibility Modes

### 1. Live Results
- Results update in real-time as votes come in
- Default mode for maximum transparency

### 2. After Voting
- Results only visible after the ballot closes
- Prevents strategic voting based on current results

### 3. Manual Control
- Creator decides when to make results visible
- Maximum control over result disclosure timing

### 4. Never Show Results
- Results are never visible to voters
- Useful for internal polls or surveys

## Additional Controls

### Show Partial Results
- When enabled: Shows all elimination rounds
- When disabled: Shows only final winner
- Helps control information complexity

### Results Visible to Public
- Controls whether results are visible to all voters
- Creator can always see results regardless of settings
- Allows for private result viewing

## User Experience Features

### For Ballot Creators:
- Intuitive visibility controls during ballot creation
- Real-time visibility management after creation
- Clear descriptions of each visibility mode
- Visual feedback for setting changes

### For Voters:
- Clear messaging when results are hidden
- Informative explanations of why results aren't visible
- Seamless experience when results become available
- No confusion about result availability

## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Changes:
- All new fields are optional with sensible defaults
- Backward compatibility maintained for existing ballots
- Proper indexing maintained for performance

### Security:
- Only ballot creators can modify visibility settings
- Proper authentication checks throughout
- No unauthorized access to hidden results

### Performance:
- Efficient queries with proper filtering
- Minimal impact on existing functionality
- Real-time updates without page refresh

## Testing Status
- TypeScript compilation: ✅ Passed
- Frontend compilation: ✅ Passed  
- Backend compilation: ✅ Passed
- All components properly typed and integrated

## Next Steps for Testing
1. Start development server with `npm run dev`
2. Create a new ballot with different visibility settings
3. Test visibility controls as both creator and voter
4. Verify real-time updates work correctly
5. Test all visibility modes and combinations

## Files Modified
- `convex/schema.ts` - Added visibility fields to ballot table
- `convex/ballots.ts` - Updated mutations and queries for visibility control
- `src/components/ResultsView.tsx` - Added hidden state handling and creator controls
- `src/components/BallotView.tsx` - Integrated visibility management
- `src/components/CreateBallot.tsx` - Added visibility settings to creation form

This implementation provides comprehensive result visibility controls while maintaining a clean, intuitive user experience for both ballot creators and voters.
