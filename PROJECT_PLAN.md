## Implementation Notes

### Technical Considerations
- Maintain Convex real-time architecture for all new features
- Ensure all features work with existing anonymous voting system
- Follow established TypeScript and React patterns in codebase
- Maintain mobile-first responsive design principles

### Research Insights
Based on analysis of successful RCV platforms (RankedVote, Polly, OpaVote):
- **Mobile optimization** is the #1 user complaint with existing tools
- **Voter education** is crucial for RCV adoption and proper usage
- **Email invitations** significantly improve participation rates (30-50% increase)
- **Result controls** are essential for maintaining election integrity
- **Accessibility** is becoming a legal requirement, not just nice-to-have

### Success Metrics
- User adoption and retention rates
- Ballot completion rates (target: >80%)
- Mobile usage percentage (current industry average: 60-70%)
- Time to create and share ballot (target: <5 minutes)
- Voter education engagement (tutorial completion rates)

## Next Steps
1. Start with **mobile optimization** - highest impact, foundational improvement
2. Implement **email invitations** - major participation driver
3. Add **result visibility controls** - critical for creator trust
4. Focus on **voter education** - key differentiator for RCV platforms
